## Problem Title
E-Waste Facility Locator
## Problem Description
Website that tells you the location of the nearest e-waste collection and recycling facility. Offers educational pop-ups on the harmful components of your e-waste and their effects on the environment and human health if not disposed correctly. There could be an option to input the model of your old device and earn credit points relative to the amount of precious metals recovered from the device if disposed correctly.
## Problem Creater's Organization
Ministry of Environment

## Idea
Our inspiration for creating the E-waste facility locator website stemmed from a shared concern for the increasing environmental and health hazards caused by improper disposal of electronic waste. We wanted to empower individuals to make responsible choices when disposing of their old devices while raising awareness about the harmful components within e-waste.Users can easily find the nearest e-waste collection and recycling facilities by entering their location. The website provides a list of nearby facilities, along with detailed information such as addresses, contact details, and operating hours.
